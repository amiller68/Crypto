I'm making chocolate chip cookies, possibly the greatest dessert of all time. I had a lot of work to do, and I'm very proud of my chocolate chip cookie. 
I really wanted a cookie with a crispy edge, a chewy, gooey center, and the right balance between the butterschotchy flavors from vanilla and brown sugar and all the chocolate mix in.

I like using two different kinds of chocolate. I like to fold in milk chocolate and dark chocolate. Chopping some of the chocolate so you get big pieces and then like little smaller bits
folded in. And very importantly, browing the butter. I like the mix of milk and dark chocolates, because for me, too much dark chocolate is too intense and I don't enjoy it. 

Ingredients: butter, two large eggs, a little baking soda, two tablespoons heavy cream, kosher salt, vanilla extract, granulated sugar, dark brown sugar, all purpose flour, then milk
chocolate and dark chocolate baking discs.
